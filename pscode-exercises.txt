// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Add integer to integer to produce sum of integers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Print odd for integers divided by 2 that produce a floating point number
Print even for integers divided by 2 that result in an integer

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Input from customer:  v1 = 5, v2 = 3, v3 = 2, v4 = 1, v5 = 4

(5 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4) = 15 / total number of variables = average of 3

Is v4 <= (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5)
If yes = print min

Is v1 >= (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5) 
If yes = print max

Average equals 3
Min is equal to 1
Max is equal to 5
